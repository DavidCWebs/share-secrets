Share Secrets
=============
A Python 3 wrapper for the debian ssss package implementation of [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme][1].

To split a secret, run `./split.py`. This runs an interactive terminal session that configures and runs `ssss`. The output shares are stored as individual files, each with a suitable descriptive introduction. This eases the distribution of your secret shares.
